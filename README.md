## üîç Overview

The **LinkedIn Job Scraper** project is an end-to-end solution for scraping job listings from LinkedIn. It leverages:

- **Python** for web scraping (with `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas`).
- **n8n** for visual automation workflows that run the scraper, process CSV data, and (optionally) integrate with Notion.
- **Docker** to containerize the environment so that you can run the entire system in a consistent, isolated environment.
- **Cloud deployment** options (with Render, Heroku, AWS, etc.) to run the automation continuously.

The project extracts key job details such as job ID, company name, title, posting time, location, description, and more. It uses random user agents and robust error handling to work around LinkedIn‚Äôs request limits.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

Your project folder should include the following key files:

- **`Dockerfile`**  
  Creates a Docker image based on the official n8n image, installs Python3, pip, and necessary libraries, and copies the scraper files.

- **`config.json`**  
  A JSON configuration file that defines:
  - The base URLs used for scraping.
  - Search queries (keywords, location, etc.).
  - Timeout, delay, retry settings.
  - CSV filename and output fields.

- **`scraper_final.py`**  
  The Python script that performs the actual scraping:
  - Loads configuration.
  - Generates random headers.
  - Scrapes job IDs and job details.
  - Saves the scraped data into a CSV file.
  - Provides detailed logging (with colored output) to help with debugging.

- **`my_n8n_template.json`**  
  An n8n workflow template that:
  - Triggers the Python scraper.
  - Loads the generated CSV.
  - Parses and transforms the data.
  - Pushes job entries into a Notion database.
  - Handles duplicate entries and error logging.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. **`config.json`**  
   Customize the configuration parameters such as:
   - `BASE_LIST_URL` and `BASE_JOB_URL`: Base URLs for job listings and job details.
   - `SEARCH_QUERIES`: An array of search queries with keywords, location, and filters.
   - `NUM_JOBS_PER_QUERY`: Number of job IDs to fetch per query.
   - Timeout, delays, retry settings, and output CSV filename.
   
2. **n8n Workflow (`my_n8n_template.json`)**
  This JSON file defines the n8n workflow:
    - Nodes include:
    - Execute Command Node: Runs the Python scraper.
    - File Nodes: Load the generated CSV and configuration file.
    - Data Transformation Nodes: Parse CSV data, remove duplicates, and transform job data.
    - Notion Nodes (Optional): Create or update job entries in a Notion database.
    - You can copy and paste the content of `my_n8n_template.json` into a workflow inside n8n


---

# In Practice: What This Means for Your n8n Automation

### **Render**
  - **Setup:** Upload your n8n Docker container via a simple dashboard.
  - **Continuous Operation:** The service is designed to run 24/7 without manual intervention.
  - **Hardware:** You get shared CPU and moderate memory (around 512 MB), which is ideal for light to moderate automation loads.
  - **Plain Terms:** You basically ‚Äúdrop‚Äù your app in and Render handles everything‚Äîno need to worry about security patches, OS updates, or uptime.

### **Heroku**
  - **Setup:** Deploy your code with Git; Heroku manages the environment.
  - **Continuous Operation:** Free dynos sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. For always‚Äëon, upgrade to Hobby dynos (costing around $7/month).
  - **Hardware:** Free dynos provide roughly 512 MB RAM on shared hardware.
  - **Plain Terms:** It‚Äôs super easy to get started, but if you need your automation to be always running, you might have to spend a little on a Hobby plan.

### **IBM Cloud**
  - **Setup:** Use guided wizards for deploying containers or functions with minimal manual configuration.
  - **Continuous Operation:** Lite plans are designed to be persistent, although some services might suspend after long inactivity.
  - **Hardware:** Typically provides modest shared resources (256‚Äì512 MB RAM).
  - **Plain Terms:** IBM Cloud offers a range of managed, free services that are good for experimentation, without requiring you to manage a full server.

### **Oracle Cloud**
  - **Setup:** You set up your own Linux VMs. This gives you full control but requires learning basic server management (security updates, DB configuration, etc.).
  - **Continuous Operation:** VMs run 24/7 continuously.
  - **Hardware:** Each VM comes with about 1 vCPU (shared) and 1 GB RAM.
  - **Plain Terms:** You get your own mini‚Äëserver that always runs‚Äîbut you‚Äôll need to learn a bit about setting it up and keeping it secure.

### **AWS**
  - **Setup:** You can choose a serverless approach with Lambda (which is easier for small tasks) or deploy an EC2 instance for persistent operation (which requires more setup).
  - **Continuous Operation:** Lambda is always free for event‚Äëdriven tasks; EC2 free tier lasts 12 months.
  - **Hardware:** An EC2 micro instance typically offers 1 vCPU and 1 GB RAM.
  - **Plain Terms:** AWS is very powerful but can be overwhelming due to its many services and configuration steps.

### **GCP**
  - **Setup:** Deploy on a free F1‚Äëmicro instance in supported regions; configuration for security and networking is required.
  - **Continuous Operation:** The F1‚Äëmicro runs 24/7 in regions where it‚Äôs available free.
  - **Hardware:** Offers about 0.2 vCPU (burstable) and around 0.6 GB memory, with 30 GB HDD storage.
  - **Plain Terms:** GCP provides a free mini‚Äëserver in certain regions but may require a bit more reading to set up properly.

### **Microsoft Azure**
  - **Setup:** Deploying on Azure requires manual configuration of a B1S VM, along with setting up security and storage.
  - **Continuous Operation:** VMs run continuously once set up, but the free tier is only available for 12 months.
  - **Hardware:** Typically 1 vCPU and 1 GB RAM with 30 GB SSD storage.
  - **Plain Terms:** Azure is robust and secure but is more complex and better suited for enterprise use rather than a simple hobby project.

### **Summary for Beginners Needing Continuous 24/7 Operation**
  - **Best Overall for Ease & Continuity:** Render tops the list because it offers a fully managed, always‚Äëon environment with a simple, beginner‚Äëfriendly deployment process.
  - **Next Best:** Heroku is very easy to set up, though its free tier ‚Äúsleeps‚Äù ‚Äî an upgrade to Hobby dynos is recommended for continuous operation.
  - **For More Control:** IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud offer persistent services with more free features, but require a bit more initial setup.
  - **More Complex Options:** AWS, GCP, and Azure are powerful but have steeper learning curves and may not be ideal if you want minimal setup hassle.

Enjoy building and automating!
